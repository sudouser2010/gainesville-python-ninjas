    *Do high level steps (3) through (10) from: instrutions-django-hello-world1

----------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1
*step (0): Install Pip

    -install pip which is a Python package managment system
    sudo easy_install pip



*step (1): Install Python virtual environment 13.0.3
    #Python virtual environment is useful because it is a Python environment
    #that will created specifically for the dependencies of this project

    sudo pip install virtualenv==13.0.3



*step (2): Create root directory called "mother1"

    -create directory called mother1
        #this will house the django project and its associated resources
        mkdir mother1



*step (3): Initialize git in root directory

    -navigate into mother2
        cd mother2  

    -create git folder
    git init



*step (4) Edit git ignore
    -create an ignore file and edit it's contents
    nano .gitignore

    -add the following files and folder to .gitignore
env1/       #env1 will be the name of the virtual environment
*.pyc       #this makes git ignore Python's byte code files
db.sqlite3  #this makes git ignore the sqlite database

    -exit nano
        Ctrl-X
        Y
        enter



*step (5): Add and commit changes to root directory with git
    -stage all files in mother2 directory
    #this stages all the non-ignored files
    git add -A

    -commit changes
    git commit -m "the root directory and environment is set up"



*step (6): Create a Python virtual environment in root directory
    -create a Python virtual environment named env1
    virtualenv env1



*step (7): Activate Python virtual environment in root directory
    -activate virtualenv
    source env1/bin/activate



*step (8): Install Django 1.8.2
    pip install django==1.8.2



*step (9): Create requirements.txt file
    #this will create a requirements.txt file, which contains a simple 
    #list of all the packages in the current environment, and their respective versions.     
    
    pip freeze > requirements.txt



*step (10): Add and commit changes to root directory with git

    -stage all files in mother2 directory
    #this stages all the non-ignored files
    git add -A

    -commit changes
    git commit -m "the Python virtual environment and its requirements have been created"



--------------------------------------------

Part 2
*step (0): Create a Django project called "yourproject"

    -make a django project called yourproject
        django-admin startproject yourproject
