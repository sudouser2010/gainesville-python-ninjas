*step (0): Install Pip
    -install pip which is a Python package managment system
    sudo easy_install pip

*step (1): Install Django
sudo pip install django==1.8

*step (2): Create root directory called "mother1"

    -create directory called mother1
        #this will house the django project and its associated resources
        mkdir mother1

*step (3): Create a Django project called "yourproject"

    -navigate into mother1
        cd mother1    

    -make a django project called yourproject
        django-admin startproject yourproject


*step (4): Create a Django app for project called "yourapp"

    -navigate into yourproject
        cd yourproject

    -make a django app called yourapp
        django-admin startapp yourapp
    

*step (5): Create template folder and template for app

    -navigate to yourapp folder
        cd yourapp

    -make a template folder in yourapp
        mkdir templates

    -navigate into templates folder

</html>

    -exit nano
        Ctrl-X
        Y
        enter
    

*step (6): Create views for app
    #note a view in Django is more like a controller in other MVC frameworks.
    #here this view has a single function called home which renders the home.html template

    -navigate one level up back to yourapp folder
        cd ..
    
    -edit the contents of views.py
        nano views.py


    -make it have the following:

from django.shortcuts import render

def home(request):
    return render(request, 'home.html', {})

    -exit nano
        Ctrl-X
        Y
        enter

*step (7): Set url mappings in project

    -navigate to directory with the urls.py file of yourproject
        cd ../yourproject

    -edit the contents of urls.py
        nano urls.py

    -make it have the following

from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url
from django.contrib import admin
import yourapp.views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^',    yourapp.views.home),
]

    -exit nano
        Ctrl-X
        Y
        enter

    -exit nano
        Ctrl-X
        Y
        enter


*step (9): Start development server
    -navigate to the folder with manage.py
        cd ..

    -run developmental server
        ./manage.py runserver


*step (10): Visit site in browser
    -in your browser, nagivate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
        #you should see hello world




----------------------------------
*note you'll see the following:
You have unapplied migrations; your app may not work properly until they are applied.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

Just ignore it, it's not important. That just means that if your app had database models, that it wouldn't work. But it doesn't because this is just a simple Hello World example
